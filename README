# Introduction

A working sample project using react-native-contacts. Tested on Android 11 and iOS 14. It retrieves all of your contacts (after successfully requesting/checking permission on Android) and then outputs a list of your contacts on screen.

## Installation

Simply clone this repo, run `npx pod install` if using iOS and then build on your device or simulator

## Additional Comments
This is a barebones app without styling, to illustrate how to get the code working and returning contacts from the address book.
